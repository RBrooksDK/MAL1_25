## Topics

This lecture will cover the logistic regression algorithm <!-- NOTE: should be specified -->

After attending this lecture and reading the corresponding part of the book, I expect you to be able to:

- Train a logistic regression (LR) model on a dataset.
- Understand the difference between linear regression and logistic regression.
- Understand the concept of maximum likelihood estimation.
- Explain the key ideas behind logistic regression, and implement a logistic regression classifier in python.
- Explain and use L1 and L2 regularization in the context of logistic regression, and discuss the difference between these approaches, as well as the importance of the hyperparameter C.
- Discuss advantages and disadvantages of logistic regression.
<!-- NOTE: I wasn't sure what exactly to take from MAL 01 -->
