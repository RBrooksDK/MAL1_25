## Session Description

Today, we are going to look at regression algorithms, where instead of predicting a class you predict some continuous variable.

We also discuss what is meant by “regularization” and consider the R² performance metric for regression. 

### Key Concepts

- Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression 
- Ridge regression 
- Lasso regression

### Learning Objectives

- Explain what is meant by "regression" and in which contexts it applies 
- Explain the following linear regression models, their strengths and weaknesses, and apply them in python: 
    - Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression 
    - Ridge regression 
    - Lasso regression 
    - Elastic Net Regression 
- Explain what is meant by the term "regularization" in an ML-context 
- Describe what is meant by "bias" and "variance" in relation to ML-algorithms 
- Explain the R²-metric for evaluating the performance of a linear regression algorithm 
- Explain the MSE metric
