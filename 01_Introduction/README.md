## Material

Chapter 1 + the pdf "kNN"

## Session Description

We will talk about what machine learning is and the types of problems we work with. We will also introduce the first algorithm: k-Nearest Neighbor.

### Key Concepts <!-- NOTE: AI-generated -->

- Distance metrics in kNN
- The parameter “k” and its effect on model performance
- Differences between low bias and low variance models
- Data normalization for distance-based methods
- Evaluating model outputs (accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.)

### Learning Objectives

- Explain what is meant by the term Machine Learning (ML)
- Explain what is meant by supervised vs. unsupervised learning
- Explain the overall difference between classification and regression
- Describe the "train-test" methodology
- Train a k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm on a dataset in sklearn
- Explain the principles behind the kNN algorithm
- Explain what is meant by the "hyperparameters" of an algorithm
