## Session Description

This lecture will cover basic machine learning methodology, the logistic regression algorithm, and the k Nearest Neighbors algorithm.

### Key Concepts <!-- NOTE: AI-generated -->

- Machine Learning (ML) overview
- Supervised vs. unsupervised learning
- Classification vs. regression
- Train-test methodology
- kNN (k Nearest Neighbors)
- Logistic regression basics
- Maximum likelihood principle
- L1 and L2 regularization
- Hyperparameters and their importance

### Learning Objectives

- Explain what is meant by the term Machine Learning (ML)
- Explain what is meant by supervised vs. unsupervised learning
- Explain the overall difference between classification and regression
- Describe the "train-test" methodology
- Train a logistic regression (LR) and k Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm on a dataset in sklearn
- Explain the principles behind the kNN algorithm
- Explain the key ideas behind logistic regression, and implement a logistic regression classifier in python.
- Explain the concept of “maximum likelihood” and how it is used.
- Explain and use L1 and L2 regularization in the context of logistic regression, and discuss the difference between these approaches, as well as the importance of the hyperparameter C.
- Discuss advantages and disadvantages of logistic regression.
- Explain what is meant by the "hyperparameters" of an algorithm
